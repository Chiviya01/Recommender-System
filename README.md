### Project Components
1. [**Jupyter Notebook**](Report.pdf). A Jupyter notebook that contains Python code and detailed comments. It includes EDA, core Code for a Recommender system, Training of a Matrix Factorization Model, Representation of tags by Word Embedding, Regularization in Matrix Factorization. Moreover, it contains small User Interactive pannel to test the recommender system by yourself. I tried to implement a small explanatory AI to improve the user experience, to make my recommendations more user-based.
